<h4>Key Players Covered in the Report:</h4>
<ul><li>Matting agents are applied on coatings in numerous applications in order to achieve a durable, scratch-proof finish and color stability. The global matting agents market has become commercially important in recent years due to the rising need for solutions to protect paints and coatings from environmental contaminants in various settings. The rapid growth of the industrial sector in several regions across the world is likely to ensure smooth growth of the global matting agents market in the coming years.</li><li>The global Matting Agents market was estimated at USD$ 448.56 million in 2016, and is anticipated to reach USD$ 556.05 million by 2021, expanding at a CAGR of 4.39% between 2017 and 2021. Matting agents alter the surface properties of an application, resulting in diffusion of incident light. These phenomena result in gloss reduction thus causing matting effect. They are available in various forms such as powders, dispersions, compounds and blends thus facilitating their easy usage.</li><li>The radiation cure systems are categorized in two groups, formulations which have organic solvents such as reactive diluents and formulations which are 100% solvent free. For formulations with solvents as diluents, matting properties depend on the property of the film. For formulations with 100% solvent free systems, in order to improve the matte finish, materials such as silica are treated with waxes and fillers, and thorough rechecks are done to get the desired matte finish. Environmental concerns are leading to matting agents manufacturers focusing on reducing the organic solvent content from paints and coatings formulations. High solid coatings contain low to zero organic volatile solvents. These coating systems are difficult to matt due to lower shrinkage and presence of high solid coarse particles and lack of the evaporation process due to the absence of solvents. However, to meet the required efficiency in matting, the particle size is matched with the dry film thickness.</li><li>The Asia-Pacific region is the largest market of matting agents, in terms of value, followed by Europe and North America. The growth can be attributed to the rapidly increasing consumption of matting agents in architectural coatings in countries such as Indonesia, India, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Growing awareness of the benefits of antiglare properties on the surfaces of coatings is expected to further benefit the growth of the Matting Agents Market over the next five years in the Asia-Pacific region. Rising income levels in these countries are also expected play a pivotal role in driving the market in the decorative paints market.</li><li>In the context of China-US trade war and global economic volatility and uncertainty, it will have a big influence on this market. Matting Powder Report by Material, Application, and Geography � Global Forecast to 2025 is a professional and comprehensive research report on the world�s major regional market conditions, focusing on the main regions (North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific) and the main countries (United States, Germany, United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea and China).</li><li>The report firstly introduced the Matting Powder basics: definitions, classifications, applications and market overview; product specifications; manufacturing processes; cost structures, raw materials and so on. Then it analyzed the world�s main region market conditions, including the product price, profit, capacity, production, supply, demand and market growth rate and forecast etc. In the end, the report introduced new project SWOT analysis, investment feasibility analysis, and investment return analysis.</li></ul>
